## Chess

[Permalink: Chess](https://github.com/code100x/chess#chess)

Building a platform where people can

1. Sign up
2. Create a new match/get connected to an existing match
3. During the match, let users play moves
4. Have a rating system that goes up and down similar to standard chess rating

## Tech stack

[Permalink: Tech stack](https://github.com/code100x/chess#tech-stack)

Let's keep it simple

1. React for Frontend
2. Node.js for Backend
3. Typescript as the language
4. Separate Websocket servers for handling real time games
5. Redis for storing all moves of a game in a queue
